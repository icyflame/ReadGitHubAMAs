# ReadGithubAMAs _WIP_

> Makes following AMA repositories like [sindresorhus/ama](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama) easy!

A list of some great AMAs:
[sindresorhus/amas](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas)

This app will show the title of an issue (which is assumed to be the question)
with the description, which provides more details about the question.

And in the answer section (which is styled in Markdown), it will provide the
first comment by the Repository owner. This is the general form of most AMA
repositories that are there on Github.
